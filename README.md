# Abraham

_Guide your users in the one true path._

Abraham injects dynamically-generated [Shepherd.js](http://github.hubspot.com/shepherd/docs/welcome/) code into your Rails application whenever a user should see a guided tour. Skip a tour, and we'll try again next time; complete a tour, and it won't show up again.

* Define tour content with simple YAML files, in any/many languages.
* Organize tours by controller and action.
* Plays nicely with Turbolinks.

## Requirements

Abraham needs to know the current user to track tour views, e.g. `current_user` from Devise.

## Installation

Add Abraham to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'abraham'
```

Then run:

```
$ bundle install
$ rails generate abraham:install
```

Require Shepherd.js in `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`

```
//= require shepherd.js.js
```

Require a Shepherd.js CSS theme in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss`

```
//= require "shepherd.js/dist/css/shepherd-theme-default"
```

Shepherd.js provides the following themes:

- `shepherd-theme-arrows`
- `shepherd-theme-arrows-fix`
- `shepherd-theme-arrows-plain-buttons`
- `shepherd-theme-dark`
- `shepherd-theme-default`
- `shepherd-theme-square`
- `shepherd-theme-square-dark`

Update `config/abraham.yml` if you choose a different theme:

```
defaults: &defaults
  :default_theme: 'shepherd-theme-arrows'
```

Tell Abraham where to insert its generated JavaScript in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`, just before the closing `body` tag:

```erb
<%= abraham_tour %>
</body>
</html>
```

## Defining your tours

Define your tours in the `config/tours` directory. Its directory structure should mirror your application's controllers, and the tour files should mirror your actions/views.

```
config/
└── tours/
    └── blog/
    │   ├── show.en.yml
    │   └── show.es.yml    
    └── articles/
        ├── index.en.yml
        ├── index.es.yml
        ├── show.en.yml
        └── show.es.yml
```

NB: You must specify a locale in the filename, even if you're only supporting one language.

### Tour content

A tour is composed of a series of steps. A step may have a title and must have a description. You may attach a step to a particular element on the page, and place the callout to the left, right, top, or bottom. 

```yaml
intro:
  steps:
    1:
      text: "Welcome to your dashboard! This is where we'll highlight key information to manage your day."
    2:
      title: "Events"
      text: "If you're participating in any events today, we'll show that here."
      attachTo:
        element: ".dashboard-events"
        placement: "right"
    3:
      title: "Search"
      text: "You can find anything else by using the search bar."
      attachTo:
        element: ".navbar-primary form"
        placement: "bottom"
```

Abraham takes care of which buttons should appear with each step:

* "Later" and "Continue" buttons on the first step
* "Exit" and "Next" buttons on intermediate steps
* "Done" button on the last step

### Testing your tours

Abraham loads tour definitions once when you start your server. Restart your server to see tour changes.
