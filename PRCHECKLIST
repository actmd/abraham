# Checklist Buddy by Mibex Software https://www.mibexsoftware.com/

# To create a new task, use '+task+' followed by the task description. 
# To create a reminder (a non-blocking comment), use '+comment+' followed by the comment text

# To filter when a task is applied, prepend the task/comment/title with one or more of the following filters:
# '--source'        - the source branch pattners
# '--source-except' - all pull requests except those matching this pattern 
# '--target'        - the target/destination branch patterns
# '--files'         - diff file pattern, similar to .gitignore

# When more than one task has the same filter settings, these are grouped as a checklist.
# Note: entries with the same filter settings will be grouped together, regardless of position in file

# To name a checklist, create a line entry with the desired filter settings and +title+ Your Checklist Title
